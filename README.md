Basic-javascript-game
=====================

Project to test out some ideas on how and what methods are best to use in creating html5 canvas javascript games

All html-files are diferent versions of tests I done. The higher the nr the more functionallity.
Later versions do link to som libraries in the folder includes.

And there are tons of badly written comments in the code. And also som plans on how to continue . I will try to do that documentaion here instead from now on.
